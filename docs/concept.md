## Sections

- System architecture and component overview
- Design choices: Behavior Trees vs other control structures
- Communication and messaging (MQTT, OPC UA integration hints)
- Extension points: adding nodes, adding agents, configuration patterns

## Intended audience

- Developers implementing new nodes or agents
- Integrators deploying MAS-BT in production environments
